# backend

This project is a MVP for a social media website.
This backend has been made with nodeJS and Sequelize. You can plug in your database but I already included models and migrations so by typing the command 

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

it should work too.


## Project setup
You'll need npm so you can install everything needed with this command
```
npm install
```
to launch the server you can then type
```
nodemon server
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
